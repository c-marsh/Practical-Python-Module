<p>
  The story takes place in Spain during the summer of 1944, five years after the
  Spanish Civil War, during the early Francoist period. The narrative
  intertwines this real world with a mythical world centered on an overgrown,
  abandoned labyrinth and a mysterious faun creature, with whom the main
  character, Ofelia, interacts. Ofelia's stepfather, the Falangist Captain
  Vidal, hunts the Spanish Maquis who fight against the Francoist regime in the
  region, while Ofelia's pregnant mother Carmen grows increasingly ill. Ofelia
  meets several strange and magical creatures who become central to her story,
  leading her through the trials of the old labyrinth garden. The film employs
  make-up, animatronics, and CGI effects to bring life to its creatures.

    <h3>Ofelia</h3>
    <p>
      Ofelia is an eleven-year-old girl who is living in wartime Spain and,
      after her father dies, is sent to live with her new stepfather, the
      powerful fascist officer Captain Vidal. She feels trapped by reality until
      her imagination takes her into an enchanted labyrinth where she meets a
      faun who agrees to help her. Ofelia is determined to save her mother and
      her unborn brother from Vidal's wicked clutches and was a friend of
      Mercedes . She is transported into the magical world where she takes on a
      giant toad and escapes from a child-eating monster, the Pale Man. When
      Ofelia returns, she faces Captain Vidal's vicious abuse and tries to
      poison him. Vidal gives chase, and Ofelia unselfishly gives up her life
      for her brother when the evil man shoots her. It is stated by Guillermo
      del Toro, that after she dies she is reborn as the princess of the
      underworld after completing her third task, which was a sacrifice of an
      innocent (which was herself).

    <h3>Captain Vidal</h3>
    <p>
      Captain Vidal, Ofeliaâ€™s stepfather, is the film's literal, real-life
      representative of fascist ideology. Indeed, he serves as an embodiment of
      Franco himself. Captain Vidal is a man obsessed with rules and regiment:
      handshake etiquette, the cleanliness of his boots, and keeping time with
      his stopwatch. Vidal's obsessions allude to Franco's own authoritarianism
      and the totalitarian nature of his regime. As the narrative progresses,
      Captain Vidal becomes a foil and antagonistic villain for the innocent
      Ofelia, who hopes to escape the repression that surrounds her. Much like
      the Franco regime, Captain Vidal controls those around him through fear
      and violence rather than compassion.

    <h3>Carmen</h3>
    <p>
      Carmen is Ofelia's mother. She was married to a tailor until he died. Now
      she is remarrying Captain Vidal, but she has grown sickly in pregnancy.
      She loves Ofelia dearly, but she does not understand her daughter's more
      fanciful side and wants to convince her to take life more seriously. Her
      disbelief in magic leads to her untimely death when, against Ofelia's
      urging, she throws the restorative mandrake root into the fire.

    <h3>Mercedes</h3>
    <p>
      Mercedes is Captain Vidal's housekeeper who also doubles as a mole for the
      Spanish Rebels. She is caring and helpful to the young Ofelia, and makes
      many sacrifices in order to support the rebel cause, but her public
      alignment with Vidal causes her grief. She is not connected to the fantasy
      world of the film at all, instead working to help the rebel cause.

    <h3>The Faun</h3>
    <p>
      The Faun (also known as Pan) is a creature that informs Ofelia of her true
      identity as Princess Moanna and guides her through the tasks that will
      allow her to return to the Underworld to be with her true parents.
      According to Guillermo del Toro, the Faun is "a creature that is neither
      good or evil....like nature....a character there to be witness and
      shephard her (Ofelia) in her rite of passage, but he has no agenda. He
      doesn't care if she dies or lives." In spite of this, it is strongly
      implied that the Faun lusts after or loves Ofelia/Moanna.
